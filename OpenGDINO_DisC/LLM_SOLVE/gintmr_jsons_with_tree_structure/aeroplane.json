    "noun": {
        "name": "aeroplane",
        "discription": "a powered flying vehicle with fixed wings and a weight greater than that of the air it displaces"
    },
    "object1": {
        "name": "helicopter",
        "discription": "in parallel with 'aeroplane', is a type of rotorcraft in which lift and thrust are supplied by horizontally spinning rotors"
    },
    "object2": {
        "name": "glider",
        "discription": "in parallel with 'aeroplane', is a type of aircraft that is supported in flight by the dynamic reaction of the air against its lifting surfaces, and whose free flight does not depend on an engine"

    },
    "object5": {
        "name": "rocket",
        "discription": "in parallel with 'aeroplane', is a vehicle, missile, or aircraft that obtains thrust by the reaction of the rapid ejection of fast-moving exhaust gas from within a rocket engine"

    "object6": {
        "name": "zeppelin",
        "discription": "in parallel with 'aeroplane', is a type of rigid airship named after the German Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, which was invented in the early 20th century"
    },
    "object7": {
        "name": "hang glider",
        "discription": "in parallel with 'aeroplane', is a glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure, the pilot is in a harness suspended from the airframe, and controls the aircraft by shifting body weight"
    },
    "object8": {
        "name": "space shuttle",
        "discription": "in parallel with 'aeroplane', is a spacecraft capable of being launched into space and returning to Earth to be used again, primarily used by NASA for space transportation"
